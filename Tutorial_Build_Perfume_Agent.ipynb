        "### 📔 1. The \"Scent Notebook\" Metaphor (The Atelier UI)\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Design Philosophy**: We want users to feel like they are jotting down fleeting poetic memories, not \"engineering prompts.\"\n",
        "- **The Implementation**: The UI uses a clean, multi-line text area labeled *\"Scent Notes\"* rather than *\"Prompt\"*. This subtle psychological shift encourages users to input abstract, emotional descriptions (e.g., *\"Dust motes dancing in afternoon sun\"*) rather than technical keywords. Our backend then \"translates\" these poetic notes into high-fidelity **FLUX.1** prompts.\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **The Spark (Salon)**: The user chats with *Le Nez* about a vague childhood memory. Through the *3-Stage Persona Flow*, Le Nez helps identify the key olfactory markers (e.g., \"Petrichor,\" \"Old Paper,\" \"Cedar\").\n",
        "2.  **The Transfer**: The user takes these identified notes into the **Atelier Notebook**.\n",
        "3.  **The Synthesis**: The backend combines these distinct \"Notes\" with the \"Perfume Name\" to structure the final image generation, ensuring the visual bottle design matches the emotional tone established in the chat.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 📜 3. History as \"Scent Memos\" (Context Management)\n",
        "We don't just have a \"Chat History\"; we have **\"Scent Memos\"**. To maintain immersion while managing costs and token limits, we implemented a strict **Context Management Strategy**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Privacy-First Persistence**: Conversation history is persisted locally on the client side using **Pinia** state management with `localStorage` persistence. The server stays stateless.\n",
        "- **The \"Rolling Window\" Strategy**: When communicating with the LLM, we use a **Sliding Context Window** (System Prompt + Last 10 Exchanges). This ensures *Le Nez* remembers the immediate context of the current session without blowing up the token budget or confusing the model with stale data."
